# README

This is my first attempt at creating a rails project. I am making a website for a [local Manassas Moving Company](https://www.ablemoving.com/) and I really hope I can make something special by utilizing Ruby on Rails.

My experience with rails is nothing compared to my experience with local moving companies near me. I seem to know everyone who has a moving truck in the Northern Virginia area. That includes movers in the surrounding Arlington, Alexandria, and Fairfax areas.

Back to the fun stuff. I typically like building websites in either Weebly or Wordpress, but I wanted to give a Ruby on Rails site a chance. I'm mainly looking for SEO benefits and I think this will be an excellent test to find out just how effective it is. I've been doing this for a long time and have ranked some websites in areas I thought was impossible. However, ranking Manasssas Movers has proved to be the hardest of them all. 

## Manassas Moving Company - what does it mean?

I've been working with my local mover in Manassas VA over the past couple of months and I've helped generate a ton of leads so far. AdWords is by far the easiest way to get results for your clients, fast too. The great thing about AdWords is that it tells you if you're on the right track. When using AdWords, you get data on which keywords perform better than others. I've learned that the two most important keywords by far are [Moving Company Manassas](https://www.ablemoving.com/) and Movers Manassas.
